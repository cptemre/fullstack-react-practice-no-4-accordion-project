# ACCORDION PROJECT

## FULLSTACK REACT PRACTICE PROJECT NO: 4

1. I created this project to practice my skills using Javascript, React, NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, HTML, CSS.

2. I practiced useState and useEffect hooks.

3. It tries to get the data from the cloud. If it won't be successful it gets the information from the local hobbits.js file. Because there is no password of my cloud account in this repository, it will take the data locally.

4. This is a page which has questions and answer that you can see by clicking '+' or close it by clicking '-'.
